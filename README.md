# RandomTerrainWebsite
A website front page with random interactive terrain

Using p5js, creates a interactive, randomly generated terrain using perlin noise. Built this project as a way to learn about the following:
- p5js
- WEBGL
- HTML canvases


The 'Buttons' are currently just invisble html elements. Would like to learn ray tracing or color picking to select 3d objects in webgl.
